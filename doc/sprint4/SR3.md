## Reflections
**1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?**

We should keep collaborating with each other, as it helps reduce unnecessary friction between user story merges; more importantly,
it ensures everyone is headed in the right direction - a second set of eyes is crucial to stop developers accidentally taking the user story
in a direction not intended, or constructing it in such a manner that will make future use difficult.

Pulling off development and branching user stories off that is also important to ensure everyone's base-plate is the same. In Sprint 3, we realized
this is particularly important for feature branches with multiple subtask branches that two different developers are contributing to. Both subtasks
being on the same base plate allow the developers to help each other better. If two developers pull different versions of the code (e.g. 1 from
development and 1 from an older commit or forgets to pull at all), it makes collaboration significantly harder - even though in the long run this problem
resolves itself come merge-time.

The third practice we did well was accurately documenting the backend API into Swagger, which helps developers understand the current state better than
opening up the file itself and searching for changes, or having to ask in team group chat and wait for a response.

**2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?**

We have established the following guidelines for Sprint 4:
* Starting coding early. Do not leave things until the last few days for user stories; there could be unforeseen problems that might take extensive hours and time to resolve. Other developers may also not have the time to step in either.
* We want to communicate exactly what "done" means for a user story better amongst ourselves - especially for dependent ones. This allows other developers to code with the correct idea in mind, rather than having to redo some parts since they were expecting one thing and got something else.

**3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?**

We agreed not to do the following:
* Delaying the start of a user story
* Not checking S0 handout for specific dates on when the sprints start/end
* Not asking in course discord if we have any questions about our marks

The last point in particular would have helped us start our sprint earlier if we had adhered properly to it. Next sprint, we plan to. The takeaway from this question is to always clarify any uncertainties about a sprint ASAP. Otherwise, a delay could prove costly in the real-world, especially for all the sprints afterwards that might be impacted by a delay.

**4. What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 3?**

Our best experience was having group members step-up at the last minute to ensure a demo-able project. We also had active communication almost the whole between members in the course discord, with several offshoot zoom calls for pair programming and explanations.

Our worst experience was the github crash on the last day the work was due. We also faced several compiler issues due to one user story that proved too massive to leave to one person (PP-68). Takeaway: If a user story involves affecting a large part of the codebase, always assign two sets of eyes to it to ensure nothing puts the demo-able project in jeopardy. It's no one's fault in particular - just good sense to have that security.

## Unfinished Tasks:
