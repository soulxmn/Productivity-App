# Release Planning Meeting

## The Release Goal
We aim to provide a fully functional and feature-rich productivity homepage/toolset for Google Chrome as a browser extension, that users can start their day with and use 
throughout to stay updated with their schedule. 

The experience will be gamified - points will be alotted for completing tasks on-time. These points will unlock unique features such as music integration, social media
access, aesthetic and wallpaper customization, and detailed history and statistics that can provide valuable insight about the user's productivity.

## The Scope of the Project 
**Completion Date:** April 8, 2022. Due to the short life of the project, the sprint goals more or less align with the major release goals, save for Sprint 2 (which doesn't have an explicit goal). That information is viewable in the Release Plan. For this reason, potential sprint goals discussed are regarding the team and their experiences instead, as follows.

### Potential Sprint Goals:
* Sprint 1: Each team member familiarizing themselves intimately with the various technologies introduced.
* Sprint 2: Becoming comfortable with github workflow, peer review, code optimization in a group project setting/collaborating with team members.
* Sprint 3: Feeling fully confident in the application of the software architecture, and the MVC pattern for an "simultaneously-developing" project.
* Sprint 4: Understanding the full-stack development of the project from start to finish in all aspects.

### Key Features:
* To-do list for creating/deleting/labeling tasks, tagging with prioritization, and grouping them under project 'folders' if/as necessary.
* Scheduling/re-scheduling certain tasks in advance to help users aim up to a year ahead - incorporating long-term plans/usage in the app.
* Providing statistics and history such as weekly/monthly task completion rate, number of tasks post-poned, task completion streak, points earned, month to month comparison, and so on and so forth.
* Gamifying the completion of tasks, logging points earned, and allowing users to spend them in a "widget shop" for additional features.

## Release Plan:
Note: US# refers to the User Story number from the Product Backlog.md _as it appears on JIRA_.

**1.**
For the first epic, the **release goal** here is a basic working product that allows task creation, and associates them to a registered account. Treyvon, our persona for a semi-basic user might be satisfied at this stage or still be able to gain benefit. This version should also include the documentation setup and TypeScripts.

| **Epic: Release V.1 Launch** | **Date: Feb 10** | **Stage: End of Sprint 1** |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| US#3: Tasks are able to be added and deleted to and from the to-do list an unlimited amount by any user. | US#8: A new note can be created by tapping anywhere. | US#1/2: Registration/login is fully functional and secure. |
| Story: Every team member will become familiar with Github, understands the MVC and software architecture, and at some level can use the technologies set up. | Story: Light Q/A testing regarding account creation and task creation is done. | Story: Project technologies (Material UI, ReactRouter, Axios, Swagger documentation etc.) will be initialized and setup along with the Release --> Developer --> Feature Github workflow branches. |

**2.**
For the second epic, the **release goal** here is to have added all the remaining features categorized as necessary for the final product to fully meet the needs of all three personas (the basic user, the power user, and the semi-serious user). Depending on the success of the previous sprint (Sprint 2), this stage may also include starting work on the "luxury" or gamified perks, benefits, and features that distinguishes our app from others.

| **Epic: Release V.2 Launch** | **Date: Mar 4** | **Stage: End of Sprint 3** |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| US#9: Accumulating points for completing tasks. | US#5/6: Scheduling/rescheduling tasks. | US#4: Grouping tasks into projects. |
| US#21: Do Not Disturb mode is available. | US#7: History and statistics page is live. | US#14: Notification from upcoming events and important tasks. |
| US#15: Prioritization tagging on tasks. | US#16: Allowing users to rearrange widgets on dashboard for optimization. | US#17: Keyboard shortcuts for streamlining UX. |
| US#18: Built-in Pomodoro timer to aid user productivity. | US#19: Ambient sounds to help user focus. | Story: Ensure order of functionality/usage does not impact UX. |

**3.**
Finally for the third and final epic, the **release goal** here is to ensure that as each extra feature is added, all the prior essential features continue to work correctly. All user stories should be complete by the time this version is released.

| **Epic: Final Product (Release V.3) Launch** | **Date: Apr 6** | **Stage: End of Sprint 4** |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Story: Layout and design of the app's UI is reconsidered one final time to optimize usability after having added all the features. | Story: Exhaustive Q/A full-scope unit tests are created, to ensure all the parts work together before adding each nice-to-have feature. | Story: Team presents finished product to course instructors/TAs.|   
| US#10: Spending points on widgets in the store. | US#11: Weather widget is functional. | US#12: Background/banner/theme/aesthetic customization. | 
| US#13: Music player integration. | US#20: Visual indicator of past projects completed to motivate user. | Story: Review documentation to ensure user will not be confused on how to proceed at different stages.
