# Definition of Done:
To be done means the following:

* Code has been written and has been implemented to the corresponding requirements of the user story. Such that the desired task in the user story can now be completed using the software.

* Criteria of Satisfaction must be met for the user story as well.

* The code has been documented properly with comments and docstrings. This means for functions and methods in a docstring they are accurately described as to their purpose and role, and clearly describe the correct inputs and outputs of the function or method. All classes clearly have their attributes and representations (i.e. what they represent defined) documented.

* Coding style:
  - All names of variables, classes, class attributes, function parameters, function names, etc. have meaningful and clearly understood names.

  - Any boolean statements are labeled as to what they are testing/checking for, or where possible, are named (that is being replaced by a variable, appropriately named for the condition).

  - Any complex set of code should be commented explaining its goal, and a loose description of how it does this.

* Testing:
  - Unit tests have been written to test at least 80% of use cases of the feature and passed accordingly. All written functional tests must pass.

  - The code has been deployed into a testing environment where all other features still pass 100% of their tests, and the new feature passes itâ€™s test as well.

  - Tests are written to check the features functionality with other components pass (if applicable).  

* Code has been reviewed. Upon all of the above items being completed the code must be submitted to review where another team member must read through the code, check for bugs, errors, failing tests, and readability/documentation. If the feature is related to design, then it must pass a visual inspection too. Upon passing review the feature is to be merged or rebased into the development branch.  If the feature fails a review, the developer must go back through and address any comments made, before requesting review again.
