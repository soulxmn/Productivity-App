### **Decision Making**
* First, we use the Planning Poker method, to estimate the effort and relative size of development goals.
* Based on the estimate assigned using the modified fibonacci sequence scale listed in our readings, if its within the range of 1 - 13 we go ahead with it. If its within the range to 20-100 we find way's to divide the task further or wait till we completed a bit more of the project that could be used to accomplish the large tasks. Anything above that must be discussed further. 


### **Prioritizing user stories**

We are going to be using the Kano model for prioritizing features and user stories into :
* **Mandatory quality** - qualities that are basic and should absolutely be there in our product. The absence of these qualities can frustrate the customers/users of the app 
* **Desired quality** - qualities that are usually linked to performance and can either increase or decrease customer satisfaction
* **Delightful quality** - qualities that can most definitely satisfy the customer/use but will not cause any dissatisfaction if they are not present.

### **Meetings**
 
* We will meet on Mondays and Fridays on zoom.
* We will log a short summary of what we discussed under the meeting minutes section on discord. This way if anyone misses any meeting they can keep track of what they missed.
* It is mandatory for all members to attend both these meetings.


### **Next Phase**

* **Features** need to be realistic
* **Communication** is very important and needs to be maintained throughout the project in order to ensure that the project goes smoothly.
* **Workload** should be divided equally among all members and should be realistic and well achievable within the given timeframe.
* **Help** each other out throughout the course of the project.
