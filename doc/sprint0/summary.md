A quick overview and direction of the project.

## Part 1: The Project Objective
Create a gamified productivity app for Google Chrome as a browser-extension that provides users a robust environment to keep track of their day-to-day workflow, as well as integrate their lives over longer periods of time (similar to a calendar). The app will function as a home/new tab page for users to be able to get a quick snapshot of their day when they log on. They should also be able to seamlessly transition from one task to another, and take breaks from their tasks - all within the workspace our app provides. To this end, there will be social media and music integration, in addition to the task planners, schedulers, and to-do lists. The app also provides rich stats and trends that display meaningful insights on the user’s history of task completion and levels of productivity.

## Part 2: The Key Users
This app should be usable by people of all ages and any familiarity with technology - whether that be the tech-savvy or individuals who are luddites. Whether they be old or young, busy or free - the app will provide a customizable interface to ensure it doesn’t overwhelm those looking for a simpler experience, whilst also providing a feature-rich environment to those who are looking for more. 

- An example of a key user is Lisa Emmanuel, a 50-year-old lawyer. Lisa has to manage a team of underling junior lawyers at her firm, so a busy schedule means she has no time to waste on extravagant features - she wants to know exactly what the day holds, as quickly as possible. An error in her time-management, such as missing a crucial meeting, could cost her team valuable points during the weekly key performance indicators reviews. 
- Aayan Thompson on the other hand is a 26-year-old junior developer who is constantly looking to make the most out of his technologies and toolsets. He loves to discover and use all the features of new software he finds. Aayan is the type of user who will appreciate a more complex interface - one that allows him to do whatever he wants. To this end, our app will deliver features such as a wallpaper, a weather widget, zoom meeting access, and a calendar (among many more).

These two personas represent a power and basic key user dynamic, and between them incorporate the group of people with varying comfortability in using modern technology.

## Part 3: The Key Scenarios
### Scenario 1:
Lisa has just received a notification from her boss that their firm is taking up an unexpected class-action lawsuit against Walmart Inc. by a group of former employees claiming wage theft due to strategic firing by management just before end-of-year bonuses were rolled out. The deadline to fill out the official paperwork and forms is fast approaching just a week later, so it’s all hands on deck. Unfortunately, Lisa had already planned and confirmed a week of one-on-one career guidance meetings for her team of junior lawyers. They had job reviews coming up regarding their performance, and she wanted to provide some useful coaching advice. This new lawsuit has thrown a wrench in her plans for the week. A neat solution is offloading the extra paperwork required onto her team - but this will require careful planning and calendar adjustment to make sure no member is overwhelmed with tasks, or given an impossible timeframe. Lisa needs a planning app where she can record all of her required tasks and build out a work schedule calendar for her team.
- A robust yet easy-interface planner will meet the urgent needs of Lisa during this stressful time. 

### Scenario 2:
Lately, Treyvon has been feeling demotivated with looming exams and a history of moderately okay grades. He knows he needs to improve his study habits if he wants to pass his courses and get into a respected college or university - but he is not feeling very confident at the moment. In particular, his math mark appears to be quite low. Treyvon could really use something that pushes him forward with small steps of accomplishment - something he can look back on later and see all the things he’s successfully completed. Treyvon needs something that could build back his confidence brick by brick. Maybe starting off small and recording just a handful of math questions as a daily homework task could help break down the intimidating magnitude of studying required for the exam - and subsequently encourage him to complete a smaller portion at first. 
- A simple interface will keep Treyvon from feeling over-encumbered.
- A gamified tracking system for receiving points will help Treyvon build confidence.

### Scenario 3:
Aayan’s team at work handles their tasks pretty well, leaving himself comfortably able to accomplish his own project assignments on time. With a mostly empty schedule, he doesn’t seem to require an overly complicated schedule manager. However, this does leave him feeling a little unfulfilled. A more immersive, fun, and ridden with unique features type of productivity app could help keep him more engaged with tracking his life and tasks on a day-to-day basis.
- Aayan seems the type of user to really enjoy the social media and music integrations.

## Part 4: The Key Principles
Our primary values below demonstrate the prioritization of convenience and base-functionality, over nice-to-have not-required features.

- Prioritize to-do list note functionality over social media app integration. 
- The user gets an immediate overview of their upcoming day. 
- To optimize our user’s workflow by providing frequent statistics on past performance.
- Remove workflow friction from the UI by: presenting upcoming tasks in chronological order, allowing the user to type anywhere to input new tasks, Chrome extension architecture to be easily accessed in the new tabs.
- Avoid feature overload while maintaining user autonomy. 
- Gamify a user’s workflow projects and day-to-day experience by allocating points for each task.
