# Introduction
This document will show case the UX/UI designs created by the team to indicate the intended vision of the final product.

The Figma link for these mock-ups is here: https://www.figma.com/file/Os65tKuUui7ejxiZScmS7W/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

# Dashboard Mock-Up
Below is a quick layout of the main/home page, which pops up whenever a user opens a new tab in the Google Chrome web browser (or launches the program).

The user’s currently active widgets will be displayed on the right side of the screen.  The right sidebar is scrollable and 
rearrangeable, so users can choose which widgets are displayed at a certai n point. Some widgets are tailored towards helping
the user stay on task, as per User Story 18. Others are for the purpose of tracking productivity as per User Story 20, so that users
are rewarded within the app for completing tasks.

# New Note/Task Creation Mock-Up

![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/Myn9XXE.png)

The “New Task” modal is triggered by a global keystroke (in any app) for quick access to create a task. Users can schedule the task to be due in the future, and also assign the task to an existing (or new) project.

For example, Lisa triggers this modal throughout the day to quickly add project tasks and deadlines that she needs to keep track of.

# Project Information Tab Mock-Up

This project modal is shown when a user clicks on one of their projects from the dashboard. The modal showcases
the various tasks inputted by the user which are required for the completion of the project. The user is able to document
their progress and journey of the task by writing notes. Once the user is done all the sub-tasks, they can move this project to 
“done”.

# User Settings Mock-Up

The settings screen allow the user to manage their account information security and change the appearance on the app. This will help Scenarios 1 and 2, where the users manage their information with an easy-to-use side menu, which they can click on and show the relevant screens. The "Account Settings" is shown here, allowing the user to change their personal information and notifications. For Scenario 3, the integrations item is added to enable Treyvon to link their Spotify account and social media accounts. 

# Widget Store/Perks Storyboard

![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/JNTtSS3.png)

As per user story 10, after earning a certain amount of productivity points, locked widgets and add ons can be bought  by an average user, which will be added to the list of unlocked widgets on the top half of the page. A user can search for a certain widget and filter for certain kind of widgets( for example: backgrounds, themes, music app related widgets, calendars, graphs, etc). And as per user story 12 after unlocking certain backgrounds and themes one can also customize their planner as well.
 
The bottom half of the screen shows all the locked widgets along with the number of points a user has to earn in order to unlock them. As per user story 9, if an average user wants to accumulate points he can also check out the locked widgets to see how many points they need to buy the widget or add on that  they desire. Users can search and filter through the locked widgets as well. 

# Analytics and History High-Fidelity Wireframe
This quick storyboard displays the intended path and suggested visual layout the user will be able to access. 

### 1. Front Page

Here the user is on the main screen. They should be able to easily spot the Analytics page on the left.

### 2. Statistics Page
![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/AAmV82y.png)

Here the user has clicked on Analytics, denoted by their cursor. They can now view the most commonly-requested stats: those of last month's progress regarding points earned, task statistics, and the rate of completion. Of note is the bottom right graph, which shows the daily average across the last month's log, and compares it to the current week's productivity rate using a metric of tasks completed per three hours.

### 3. Time Period Drop-Down Menu
![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/skI93Rl.png)

Here the user has clicked on the drop-down menu to compare their current statistics with previous months, going back up to 4 months (amount to be decided). This tool will also help them identify their most productive months, and maybe correlate the success (or lack thereof) to real-world changes they may have made.
