## Reflections
**1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?**

Git flow has served us well, allowing for safe and secure merging, as well as tracking. Adding the user story tags for auto-commit updates on Jira was also nice to see. All members attended the required standup meetings on time. There was good communication between the team divisions, as we had paired up for tasks and assigned subtasks to everyone. Collaboration went well in this regard.

**2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?**

We aim to better inspect our code and review before merging pull requests; we plan to do this via pair programming and multiple pass throughs. We also aim to have a functional react app. Time has been set as noon on Thursday (day before it's due with adequate 12 hour window) for merging code. This is to avoid last minute issues and resolve potential hiccups.

**3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?**

One practice was perhaps asking for help or guiding questions too late into the sprint, rather than earlier on. We aim to avoid this next sprint by not holding back if we are confused by some technology or it's application.

**4. What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 1?**

Our best experience was seeing the successful functionality of the homepage, and everyone's components working better than imagined. The base functionality was laid out, and the app was "technically" able to be used for its core purpose. 

Our worst experience was seeing all the new technologies, which while interesting and fun to learn and apply in concept, in reality meant 2 hours of reading documentation and 10 minutes of actual coding to get it right. A lot of Sprint 1 involved coding setup as well in this regard.

## Unfinished Tasks:
* PP-21: Enabling Do Not Disturb mode for a user.
  * This user story was blocked by PP-14, which is coding the actual notification pop-ups for upcoming events/tasks. After they are popping up, then we can work on silencing them.
* PP-21 Subtask: Clock component to set timer.
  * NOTE: This has been moved into a separate User Story of its own (**\[PP-18\]**) as its scope was greater than what a subtask should have.


Since there were no other unfinished tasks from Sprint 1, the grouping remains mostly the same:
* As Power User Aayan, I should be able to turn on a do not disturb mode, to help tune out distractions while I work. I want to be able to set the time limit for this. Criteria of Satisfaction:
  * A button that silences incoming notifications while enabled.
  * A <em>linked</em> clock to set the timer.
