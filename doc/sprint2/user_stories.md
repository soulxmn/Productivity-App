**Notes:** 

* We completed 7 User Stories and 1 Developer Story for a total of 8 stories out of the 9 assigned to Sprint 2 on Jira.
* 2 of the 7 User Stories were initiated and partly-demo'd in Sprint 1, and have now been fully completed (**\[PP-18\]**, **\[PP-21\]**).
  * Sprint 1 still included the required 3 "demo-able" User Stories for a total of 5 (discounting these 2) so we hope this is okay.
