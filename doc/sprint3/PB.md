## Developer Stories / Chores:
These developer stories are tasks on Jira we created to help optimize the coding process for the team as a whole as we move forward with the project. Their Criteria of Satisfaction is simply their direct implementation.

44. **\[DEPRECATED\]** As a developer, I want redux configured to store information in a global state.
    - Criteria of Satisfaction:
        1. A global state is available in which information can be stored and accessed from different portions of the app at different times.
        1. The team understands how this works and is able to make use of it for their respective user stories. 
<ol start="46">
    <li><strong>[COMPLETED]</strong> As a developer, I want to create TypeScript data models to keep the codebase organized and the types enforced.
      <ul> 
          <li>Criteria of Satisfaction:
            <ol>
                <li>Data types are configured using TypeScript so that they can be easily identified in their own file without clustering main files.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>    
    </li>
</ol>

<ol start="68">
    <li><strong>[NEW ADDITION]</strong> As a developer, I want to generally clean up, re-organize, and optimize the project code.
      <ul> 
          <li>Criteria of Satisfaction:
            <ol>
                <li>Styling should either be organized into inline for minor styling, or into CSS files for extensive styling.</li>
                <li>All components should be of the same implementation (functional component, not class).</li>
                <li>TA feedback from Sprint 2 demo should be reflected by end of this sprint (timer, calendar, date format).</li>
                <li>Task deletion changes should be reflected in the backend, not just the frontend.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>    
    </li>
    <li><strong>[NEW ADDITION]</strong> As a developer, I want to associate Tasks/Notes to a User using email address, and reflect this authorization in Notifications also.
      <ul> 
          <li>Criteria of Satisfaction:
            <ol>
                <li>A user's data regarding their Tasks and Notes is stored in the backend using the email address as association.</li>
                <li>In turn, the Notifications component should be able to successfully pull a user's task using the email address as the identifier in the backend.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>    
    </li>    
</ol>

Note: The reason **\[PP-44\]** is deprecated is because the redux was initially being implemented to allow for UUID (unique user identification number) authorization. However, we realized we can retrieve user information from the backend using endpoints if we pass in the Auth0 email instead. Thus, redux is no longer needed.
