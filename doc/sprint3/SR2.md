## Reflections
**1. What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?**

Standups went well and were effective in communicating blocks. Members were able to seek help early on and adequately to complete their respective tasks. Pairing off for tasks also raised no issues, as members collaborated respectfully and efficiently in completing their assigned subtasks and meeting with each other privately in smaller groups as needed.

**2. What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?**

We have established the following guidelines for Sprint 3:
* Consistency across codebase - talk to others about how you want to do something before doing it.
* UI changes should happen early on and the rest of the user stories for the sprint should branch off the updated development. This will help avoid massive UI merge conflicts at the end of the sprint, since everyone would have adapted to the new UI rather than the new UI having to adapt to every component.
* When creating new components, do not use class-based components. We will only do functional ones from now on.
* Mark subtasks and update Jira with comments as they arise/are completed rather than at the end of the sprint.
* Use Material-UI components.

**3. What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint?**

Starting to code our respective user stories without taking into consideration potential merge conflicts with other user stories. We have realized it is important to identify a priority order for the Jira tasks, to optimize combining code at the end of Sprint 3.

**4. What was your best/worst experience during Sprint 1?**

Our best experience was starting tasks early, which gave time for more observant coding rather than being rushed towards the end.

Our worst experience was the excessive amounts of merge conflicts the day before Sprint 2 was due, as everyone's components had been implemented for the old UI, and the new UI had to essentially be recoded to incorporate them all during merging. 

## Unfinished Tasks:
* PP-44: As a developer, I want to add react redux.
  * This developer story was unable to be completed due to over-assigning responsibilities/unforesenn schedule delays. 
  * At the same time, an alternative workaround has been identified, and therefore this developer story is deprecated and will no longer be worked on.
  
As there is no other unfinished task, there is no grouping to develop a new user story at this time.
