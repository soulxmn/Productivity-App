# Planner's Paradice

## Motivation

A gamified productivity chrome extension provides users with a robust environment to keep them engaged in their workflow. Many productivity apps lack the necessary engagement, resulting in usersâ€™ stopping using the app. This application aims to change this by introducing a gamified aspect: keeping the user engaged for more extended periods than other apps do.

## Installation

## Required tools

We will use the MERN stack for this project, consisting of MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJs for our server.

### **NodeJs**

For Windows, download the setup here: [NodeJs Download Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

For Linux and WSL2 on Windows, you must run the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Install cURL using:

```
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

As recommended by Microsoft, install nvm as the node version manager tool. To install that tool, run:

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

Install the latest LTS version of NodeJs using this command:

```
$ nvm install --lts
```

To check that you have the correct versions installed on your computer, run:

```
$ node -v
v16.6.2
$ npm -v
7.20.3
```

We also have to set up our NodeJS server and install expressJs to our project.

```
$ cd server
$ nodemon index.js
```

#### **Note**

after you git pull on the repo, you must run `npm install` on the directory that `server` was created to ensure you install all the packages on your local machine!

### **Client - React App**

**Cross-platform**: these instructions are the same for all platforms

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

By default, `npm run start` will run on `http://localhost:3000`

`npm start` will run a development server so you can preview the application. `^C` to end it.

### Server

```
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

This will start the server which will listen on port 3001. The server is connected to our MongoDB database using mongoose as the middleware.

#### **MongoDB Login Details**

This is the login details for the [MongoDB Dashboard](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Contribution

For our project, we will use the git-flow protocol. We will divide our projects into three parts:

1. Release branch
2. The development branch
3. The feature branches

### Naming the feature branches

We must name the feature branches after the user stories to ensure we all know what features we are working on. (feat/todo-list)

### Pull Requests

Group members will submit a pull request for each feature/subtask. After, at least two team members can review the code, approve it, and push it to the main and release branches.

Before testing, new feature branches must contain the latest codebase from the development branch.

Do not place any codebase from the development branch until the end of the sprint.

## Ticketing System

We will be using Jira
